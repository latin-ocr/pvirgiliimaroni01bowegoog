The N otes ure designedly mede very copious. They ere
intended to afford so much eid, thet e pupil of ordinary
cepeoity ond diligence, who bes studied the usual elemen-

stand Virgil, even without tho eid of en instructer. Iam

the pupil's own efforts, end thereby of encour ing the
formation of cereless end indolent bebits ; end 1 eve en-
deevored to obviate it, by confining the translations ιο the
more difficult esseges, removing these helps to e seperate
purt of the wodemo, end presenting them in such e form
thet, although of little service to the student till hebes
mede eod use of grammar end dictionery, they will leuve
nodi culty in bis way, when he hes once fairly consulted
these menuels. The copious meteriels ufforded by the
commentarios of the old grammariens, end by the rich enno·

editors, heve been curefully revised‚ end whatever metter
