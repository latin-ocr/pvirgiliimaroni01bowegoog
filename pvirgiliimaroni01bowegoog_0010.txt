English, will olleo mislead the pupil in respect to the mesn-
ing and grammatical connexion of the Latin words. The
choico between these difficulties seems to be naturally ds·
cided by the consideration¹ that the notes ere designed to
assint the student in understanding the Latin text, and not
in his exercises in English rhetoric. It iscom aratively
easy to change a literal translation into go English
phrases ; the pupil’s own ear, and the testeos his instruc·
ter, will be safe guides. But it is not so easy, out os a
loose paraphrase, to gain a clear idea of the precise mean·
ing of each Latin word, and os its rammatical construc-
tion. The N otes to this edition are designed to obviate the

latter difficulty, and whenever the literni interpretationis
departed from, the change is indicated in the type.

Great pains have been bestowed upon the correction
of the tent¹ in the hope os furnishing one that should he

nearly immaculate. In this, asin other respecto, itis quite
possible that the execution os the work has sellen short oi
the design. But such as it is, the edition is offered to the
ublic, rn the hope that it may lighten in some respecta the
iabor both ol pupils und instructers, end be found of some
service to the cause ol classical learning in this country.
