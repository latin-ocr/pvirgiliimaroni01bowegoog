Ia oar common classica} schools, too few pupils possess
a Classical Dictionary, and those who have oue, cao hard·
ly he iudueed to malie such use of it as shall enable them
to understand all the allusione in the text. The book ia a
cumbrous one, aad they will not consult it olleo enough aa
a separate work, though they would glsdly use the assis-
tance which it ufforde, is it were given, iu a concise form,
iu the volume which is constantly before them. The Note·
to this edition contsin a brief summary os all the informs·
tion which is needed, in order fully to understand the his-
tory, mythology, and geography of the work. The merited

nmatione, other things being equal, is a serioue objection
to them. Boys will not read diffuse remarks on subjecte
that are beyond their comprehensim, and will even be de·
terred by their presence from consulting the useful and

ructieal notes, with which they may be interspereed.
lllahorate discussions ol' vannus readings, or ol‘ different
modes of explaining an obscure passage, undoubtedly have
their use ς but they also have their place, which ie certain·

learning, that appears in such notes, cau be easily made by
one who has access to the rich stores of German eruditiori.
But a different opportunity should be sought sor its display.
ls the meaning of any passage he disputed, it is better for
the editor to exercise his learning and judgment in forming
one interpretation, and presenting it in a clear shape an
moderate compass, thau to perplex the young pupil by an
array of different explanatione, and the arguments in saror
os each. Is the teacher who uses the volume should pre·
ser a different translation to the one given, it is all well. 1f
the pupil has ingenuity enough to give another end yet in·
telligihle construction to the passage, it ia better still. 'l'be
practice os leading the notes with references to the whole
range os Latin and Greek authors, and that too lor the use
of pupils, who robahly do not possess one of the worlsa
cited, und could not read the volume is they owned it, is
wholly indetsnsible.
