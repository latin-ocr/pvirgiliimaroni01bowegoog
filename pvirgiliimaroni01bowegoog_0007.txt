PREFAOE.

Vrania is inore generally read nnd less appreciated than
hltlttttteltttt'tit: ttthtthlt:
course os classicnl studies, that they appear to the pu il
quite as difficult and uninteresting aethe grammar and e
dictionary. Months, and even years, are bestowed upon
the study oi them, and the length oi the tasls only adds to
ita wearisomeness. The associatione formed atsuch an
early period in one’s education are retained with great
tenacity through lile, and the consequence is, that these
elegant and delightlul poema call up, in the minds of most
prasus, no other or more pleasant imnges than those of the
s elling-bools, the recitation room, and, perhaps, the rod.

oraoo is usually read at a later period in the course os
stndy, when the pupil has mastered the greatest difficulties '
ot' tho langnage, and his taste and jndgment are somewhat

maturad. The productione ol the lyric poet, therefore, are

rememhered sn quoted, and a rocus-renco to the study ol
them otlen opens aneu source of pleasure lor the schol·
ar'e riper years ; while the poenis ol Virgil, more pleaslng
ae respecta the choica of a subject, and the general char·
acteristics ol their execution, nro quite generally neglected.

mentioned, than to suggest aremedy. It is quite impor-
tant, that a book put into the pupil's hands at such an early
period in his studies should be an unexceptionahle model
os style, and should oller such attractive qualities, as may
most effectuully encourage his efforts in a long and arduous
undertaking. The poema ol Vir-gil answer these requi·
sites so well, that no one is surprised at the general adop-
tion of them, as a text-book ol instruction in the Latin lan·
guage. But allowence must still he made sor the small at·
